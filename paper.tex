%% ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
This paper describes the tutorial delivered at ICWE 2016 on Building Distributed Web Applications with IPFS\@. IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System, is the distributed and permanent Web, a protocol to make the Web faster, more secure, open and available. The tutorial format focuses in key elements of IPFS and how to use it to build applications with.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

IPFS, the InterPlanetary File System, is the distributed and permanent Web, a protocol to make the Web faster, more secure, open and available. IPFS could be seen as Git meets a BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalised MerkleDAG, a data structure that can beused to build versioned file systems, blockchains, unix like file systems, amongst other options. IPFS combines a Distributed Hash Table, an incentivised block exchange and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.

This tutorial will focus on the IPFS Application Stack, including: libp2p, the networking layer; bitswap for data exchange;IPLD and the MerkleDAG, the thin waist data structure of IPFS and how to use IPFS interface to build distributed applications. The full length of the tutorial is 6 hours.

%% TUTORIAL

\section{Tutorial}\label{sec:tutorial}

The format of the tutorial is a mix between a lecture and a laboratory class. Participants will get a common base of understanding of what is IPFS through a lecture like session, following to a hands on laboratory class, where each individual will work in parallel in order to build a Distributed Web Application with IPFS, following a series of steps, starting from the network, going to the data model, design decisions on desired guarantees and so on.

During these practical steps, participants will interact with the several layers of IPFS and their respective APIs.

\subsection{Learning outcomes}

During this session, it is expected that attendees learn how to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item install IPFS
  \item use IPFS CLI
  \item use IPFS HTTPitemAPI
  \item use IPFS client libraries
  \item load an application from IPFS
  \item dial between peers, using IPFS (libp2p)
  \item learn how to build data structures on top of the Object (DAG) API
  \item learn how to use UnixFS
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target audience}

General interest in cryptography, distributed systems, data structures and P2P protocols is recommended. Familiarity with JavaScript or the Go programming languages are a bonus, however any knowledge of CS programming will suffice.

\subsection{Curriculum}

This tutorial covers the IPFS stack and topics to have into account when building distributed applications, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Merkle Trees
  \item Merkle'lized Data Structures
  \item MerkleDAG
  \item IPLD
  \item Hashing functions
  \item Distributed Hash Tables
  \item Routing strategies and protocols
  \item Peer Discovery
  \item Transport protocls
  \item IPFS HTTP API
  \item IPFS Core API
  \item IPFS CLI
  \item Data Exchange, namely bitswap
  \item Self Describable Data Formats
\end{itemize}

The tutorial is custom build for ICWE2016 audience, taking into consideration participants experience with the subject and interest.

%% PRESENTER

\section{Presenter}\label{sec:presenter}

David Dias is a P2P Software Engineer and Researcher at Protocol Labs (http://ipn.io), the company behind IPFS\@. Before, David worked on the security and web development industry at Lift Security.

David holds a P2P Masters in Science, having built the first P2P DHT using WebRTC specifically for the Web Platform for job execution distribution.

David's speaking history with regards to P2P, security and distributed systems has been the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Dec 2015 | Linux Foundation Node.js Interactive Conference. Stellar Module
Management, using IPFS for code package distribution.
  \item May 2015 | Data Terra Nemo, the P2P Conf. ``webrtc-explorer'', distributed browser
computing platform using volunteered shared resources
  \item Feb 2015 | OpoJS\@. Resource Discovery for the Web Platform on top of a P2P
Overlay Network powered by WebRTC
  \item Apr 2014 | JSConf Brazil. Securing Node.js Applications by the community and for
the community
\end{itemize}

Currently I'm also an invited Professor at the University of Lisbon, having developed a new post graduation course on modern web development.

Other relevant previous work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a 2 day WebRTC Training for O'Reilly Fluent Conf 2015
  \item Node Security researcher
  \item Part of the european research project SynergyVM while a researcher on the
distributed systems group at INESC-ID
\end{itemize}

%% CONCLUSION

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

With this tutorial, participants will become knowledgeable of the components that compose IPFS, its architecture design decisions and be confortable to build Web Applications with IPFS\@.

The materials built for this tutorial will be made available under MIT License, under the IPFS organization on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/ipfs}. Participants are encouraged to consult them at any time or distribute amonsgt their colleagues in their organization. We will continue to improve the content as IPFS evolves.

We would like to acknowledge and send our appreciation to the organizing committee behind ICWE 2016 for having invited us to make this Tutorial happen.
